# Create-JPG-Image-Datasets-from-MP4-Video
Convert and process mp4/mov video data into jpg/png image datasets for training deep learning computer vision models.

This repo contains functions and an example workflow, all given in a Jupyter notebook format, to process mp4/mov video data into conventional imagery datasets (jpg/png). The generated imagery datasets can be used to train and test deep learning computer vision models, among many potential uses.
